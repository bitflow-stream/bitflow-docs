# Welcome to the Bitflow documentation

Here a small project description is required 



## Data Format

Bitflow allows reading from a file, download data from a host:port pair or it opens a port and waits for a peer to connect and send data. Further it allows writing to a file, send data to a defined host:port pair or provides data on a defined port and waits for clients to download. Data formats are described in more detail in [data_formats](data_format.md)
